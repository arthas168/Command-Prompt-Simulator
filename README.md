Welcome to the bash.terminal.exe instruction file!
This console app is designed to simulate a custom-themed
Windows command line prompt, with integrated commands for finding
a hostile actor tracking your server, blocking his attack, and with the 
gathered information breaching his security and altering his files.

The commands below should be entered in the following order:
(After typing the command press Enter like in a standard console)
(They can all run seperately if you choose to skip one or more,
their order is purely based on the logic of the action flow)

1.route print
**This command lists all ports and connected parties to the local server.
You shouldn't notice anything wrong here.

2.ipconfig
**Again, listing all connected parties. Nothing interesting
but these two steps are needed for the next one.

3.netstat "Listen"
**Here's where the fun begins. After the listed IPs with only zeros,
you notice an unknown IP address tracking you - 192.168.101.0

4.net use 192.168.101/GPS-Coordinates
**You use the info from the previous step to infiltrate the attacker's network
and breach his files, where you discover the GPS files.

5.ReplaceText old:79.330 new:62.100
**You then alter the coordinates in the GPS files and save them without
leaving any trace of your actions. 

6.Eject all
**You finally safely leave the attackers network.

More useful info:
**There's an additional command "clear" which clears the terminal
window and the user can type his next command.

**If the user enters an invalid command (one that's not in the list)
the terminal displays an error message and the user can go
ahead and type the next command without restarting the terminal.

**IMPORTANT: you can change the theme of the console since it's different
on every system. On the top of the open console window right-click and
select "Properties". From there you can change the size, font and colors.
I highly recommend using a black background with standard green color (not 
darkgreen) text, with full screen window and a larger font size(18-20)

**If you notice and bugs or abnormal responses from the application,
or have any questions in general contact me right away. :)
